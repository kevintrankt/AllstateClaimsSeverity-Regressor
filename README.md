# AllstateClaimsSeverity-Regressor


Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, Kagglers are invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity. Aspiring competitors will demonstrate insight into better ways to predict claims severity for the chance to be part of Allstateâ€™s efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.

This repository attempts to solve this problem by applying machine learning methodologies.
